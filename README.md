# Stock-Market-Prediction-2020

This is the the final project of the course: L330 Data Science: principles and practice at the University Of Cambridge.

The task for this project is stock market prediction using a diverse set of variables. 

In particular, given a dataset representing days of trading in the NASDAQ Composite stock market, our aim is to predict the daily movement of the market up or down conditioned on the values of the features in the dataset over the previous N (trading) days.
